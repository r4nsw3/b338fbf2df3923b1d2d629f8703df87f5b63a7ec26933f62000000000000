  |   You play by focusing on the rhythm of the music. "Notes" (circular    |
  |   icons) and lines represent the music, with varied movements and       |
  |   interactions. With the right timing you TAP, DRAG and HOLD notes to   |
  |   earn the best possible score, using either the touch screen or a      |
  |   controller. The Notes are dynamic and reflect the energy of the       |
  |   music; it's a visually captivating experience.                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Cytus α is also driven by its story - you advance through Chapters    |
  |   to unlock more songs but also the memories of the Operator,           |
  |   learning more of the narrative as you play. This title also           |
  |   includes songs originally made for Chapter Ω, as well as a fully      |
  |   revamped user interface!                                              |

  |   In addition to unlocking music, challenges and the story, you can     |
  |   engage in Online Score Battles. Practice your technique and then      |
  |   try to beat online rivals!                                            |
